- **Specialized caches**: 
  - Package metadata cache
  - Dependency resolution cache
  - Search results cache
- **Bulk operations**: Efficient batch API calls

### Concurrent Operations
- **Async/await**: Tokio runtime for concurrency
- **Parallel API calls**: Futures-based concurrent processing
- **Timeout handling**: 10-second timeouts per request
- **Error resilience**: Graceful degradation

### Compatibility
- **Full Composer compatibility**: All major commands supported
- **Lock file format**: Compatible with composer.lock
- **Configuration**: Reads composer.json and Lectern.toml
- **Package sources**: Uses Packagist.org API
