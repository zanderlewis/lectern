# Lectern vs Composer Comprehensive Benchmark Report

Generated: {timestamp}

## Summary

Lectern is a high-performance Rust-based package manager with full Composer compatibility. This comprehensive benchmark tests all major commands across multiple project types.

Please note that performance is tested when both Composer and Lectern have warm caches.

### Overall Performance
- **Tests Completed**: {total_tests}
- **Successful Comparisons**: {successful_tests}
- **Average Performance Improvement**: {avg_improvement:.1f}x faster
- **Best Performance**: {best_performance:.1f}x faster
- **Architecture**: Rust with concurrent operations, multi-layered caching

## Technical Architecture

-### Caching System
- **Multi-layered caching**: Filesystem-based persistent cache in `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/lectern` (or `~/.cache/lectern`)
- **Cache structure**: SHA-256 hashed keys for efficient storage
- **Specialized caches**: 
  - Package metadata cache
  - Dependency resolution cache
  - Search results cache
- **Bulk operations**: Efficient batch API calls

### Concurrent Operations
- **Async/await**: Tokio runtime for concurrency
- **Parallel API calls**: Futures-based concurrent processing
- **Timeout handling**: 10-second timeouts per request
- **Error resilience**: Graceful degradation

### Compatibility
- **Full Composer compatibility**: All major commands supported
- **Lock file format**: Compatible with composer.lock
- **Configuration**: Reads composer.json and Lectern.toml
- **Package sources**: Uses Packagist.org API
